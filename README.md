This is the repository for TwINFER project.

The notebook TwINFER_simulation_and_analysis contains the code to simulate a cell population with any gene underlying regulatory network and parameters for each of the genes and regulatory interactions. It also has the code to infer the GRN from simulated data using TwINFER framework. Some example input data for simulation can be found in the simulation_example_input_data folder.

The code and data to estimate parameters from the literature can be found in the parameter_estimation folder.
